Q1: You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive. What is the probability that they have MMV?
The person chosen at random who has tested positive has a 95% chance of being infected by the MMV virus. With the information we have, there is no way to know if this person is part of the 5% false positive group or not.

## BMB: We know the overall prevalence of the disease and we know the sensitivity (1-false negative) and specificity (1- false positive rate) of the test, so we *do* have more information than "this might be a false positive". (We will post solutions to this problem, but this verbal logic is wrong.)


Q2: You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?
I would tell my friend that there is a very good chance that they are infected with the MMV virus, however we cannot know that with a 100% certainty. Since this test returns a false positive result 5% of the time in un-infected individuals, there is a chance my friend is simply in the false positive group, however this is terribly unlikely.

## BMB: their probability of being infected is higher than if they *hadn't* gotten a positive test, but there is not a "very good chance" that they are infected.
