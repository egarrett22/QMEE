##I hope this is the readMe file that needed to be updated for the assignment. 
## JD: Yes

##FOr the Jan22 data set that i used, the values represent a simple protein concentration curve that i had done for my undergrad thesis that later allowed me to quantify the protein i was working with 
#I worked with red algae that produced a compound called DMSP or dimethylsulfoniopropionate, and molecule that allows the algae to osmoregulate in harsh marine conditions, its it also thought to be an important player in the global sulfur cycle. I was working to characterize one of the enzymes involved in the production in DMSP, which often required me to perform protein quantifications
## JD: what are the numbers being analyzed by your script
##the numbers are absorbances readings at 750nm and mean protein concentration in mg/ml

##Assignment 2 information
##I worked off the same data as in the first assignment. This time i plotted it (simple scatter plot) and put a simple regression line through it. I didnt find any mistakes in the data. I removed the protein 1 in 2, 1 in 4, etc data from the data set because those would not be included in the protein standard concentration curve, i would rather work off the regression equation to then figure out what those absorbance value represented in terms of protein concentration. I know you both had mentioned not having blank spaces in titles, does that also apply to plot titles and axis titles? how would those best be formated?
##in terms of replicable components, in any given experiment series i have had to do protein quantification via multiple methods, i could also break data up by protein type, i tend not to only investigate one protein, but many, so the various dilution series for each protein could be broken up into replicates. 
##i was wondering what the best way would be to get the intercept as well as the regression line equation?
