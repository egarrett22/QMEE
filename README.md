I hope this is the readMe file that needed to be updated for the assignment. 
FO rthe Jan22 data set that i used, the values represent a simple protein concentration curve that i had done for my undergrad thesis that later allowed me to quantify the protein i was working with 
I worked with red algae that produced a compound called DMSP or dimethylsulfoniopropionate, and molecule that allows the algae to osmoregulate in harsh marine conditions, its it also thought to be an important player in the global sulfur cycle. I was working to characterize one of the enzymes involved in the production in DMSP, which often required me to perform protein quantifications
